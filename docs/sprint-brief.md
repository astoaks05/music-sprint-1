# Sprint 1 Brief

## Program Snapshot
ACM Introduces: the DevSprint program! If you are looking for resume-building developer experience with current tools in a low-stakes, collaborative, constructive, and growth-centered environment, this is the place for you! Working on a 4-week rotation between projects and workshops, students will have the opportunity to build and present up to 3 unique, 2-week-long projects. Our first program meeting is this upcoming Wednesday after the ACM Meeting on September 10th. Hope to see you there learning, building, and failing with style ðŸ˜Ž

## Client Prompt
Your client is asking for a new feature for their music company. Attached are stubs for an example web-app project that recommends songs.

## Working Goals
- Understand your user's problem: who needs recommendations, and why?
- Sketch out your recommendation flow (input form, recommendation display, feedback loop).
- Implement your placeholder services so your UI can surface real data.
- Collect feedback from your users and iterate during the two-week sprint.

## Ideas for Features
- Users can enter preferences (mood, genre, tempo, era, etc.).
- System returns at least five recommendations sourced from real or mock data.
- Users can like/dislike songs to refine future suggestions.
- Documentation explains how the recommendations are generated.

Update this brief as your sprint evolves.

### User Stories

As a potential fan, I'm looking for specific Stoaks songs that adhere to my musical preferences 

As an average music listener I want to be able to type in a song I like and get reccomendations for Stoaks songs I might like instead

As a newbie to the Stoaks scene I want some good first songs to listen to (default reccomendations)
